# MICRO-IT-Password-Generator

✅ Use Case

This project generates secure, random passwords that include:

At least one uppercase letter

At least one lowercase letter

At least one digit

At least one symbol


Use Cases:

Creating strong passwords for user accounts.

Building security-focused tools or applications.

Teaching cybersecurity best practices in educational settings.


🔧 Tools Used

Python – Core programming language.

random module – To select random characters.

string module – For accessing character sets like uppercase, lowercase, digits, and punctuation.


📦 Requirements

System Requirements:

Python 3.x installed.


Dependencies:

No external libraries required. Only standard Python libraries are used.


🌟 Features

✅ Ensures a strong password by including characters from four essential categories (upper, lower, digit, symbol).

🔀 Randomly shuffles characters to ensure unpredictability.

⚠️ Validates that the password length is at least 4 characters.

❌ Handles invalid input gracefully (e.g., non-numeric entries).


🎓 Learning Objectives

By building this project, you learn:

How to use randomization effectively and securely.

How to manipulate strings using built-in modules.

The importance of input validation.

How to use dictionaries and list comprehensions.

The concept of character pools and secure password structure.


📤 Sample Output:

Enter password length: 3
Password must be at least 4 characters.


🚀 Potential Improvements
Add a strength meter to rate password quality.

Allow user to customize character sets (e.g., exclude symbols).

Add a clipboard copy feature using pyperclip.

Integrate into a GUI using Tkinter.
